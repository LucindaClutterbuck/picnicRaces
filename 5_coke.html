<p>Step right in! Step right in! What an opportunity! Mr Coke has brought here today for one day only his fine English Stallion Hobgoblin and the pure white mare Roxana! So valuable they are protected here in the saddling paddock by a five foot fence! One pound to see them show their paces!</p>
<p>Suddenly the colt leaps off the merrygoround and leaps over the fence! </p>
<p>Hahaha I am the king of the Wind! I come from the desert sands! I can run for four days at a time! How far can you run Hobgoblin? Roxana come with me FAr away from the crowds!</p>
<p>Mr Coke.</p>
<p>OMG Get that viciuos and ugly beast away from my Roxana!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowd cheers as Roxana and the colt leap out of the paddock together. Hobgoblin is too big and fat to jump and he is left behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like our little colt has found true love.</p>
